### Real-time Vehicle Counting and Classification

1. Place the video file in the video_file folder or update the video file path in the code.
2. Ensure you have the required model files and 'coco.names' file.
3. Run the `realTime()` function in the provided Python script.
4. Press 'q' to exit the real-time analysis.
